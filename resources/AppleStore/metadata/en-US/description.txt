PO Contacts stands for "Privacy Oriented Contacts".

The vision and end goal of this project is to have a portable and privacy oriented contacts manager.

- Portable means you can use it on "any" platform (see supported platforms) on the website
- Privacy oriented means it's built with a "privacy first" mindset. See the privacy policy for details.

Disclaimer

I built this app on my free time and mostly as a learning experience. I intend to use it myself and I'm happy to share it publicly for free if it can help others. I also made the code available publicly, because I believe being open source is an important part of a privacy-focused app. That being said, if you choose to use it, you use it at your own risks, there is no warranty (see the licence for more details).

Features:
- Create and edit contact details
- Start email from contact
- Start phone from contact
- Start SMS from contact
- Export contacts to .vcf files
- Import contacts from .vcf files
- Protect your exported files with password-based AES encryption
