# PO Contacts

PO Contacts stands for "Privacy Oriented Contacts".

The vision and end goal of this project is to have a **portable** and **privacy oriented** contacts manager.

* Portable means you can use it on "any" platform (see [supported platforms](#supported-platforms)).

* Privacy oriented means it's built with a "privacy first" mindset. See the [privacy policy](./privacy_policy.md) for details.

## Disclaimer

I built this app on my free time and mostly as a learning experience. I intend to use it myself and I'm happy to share it publicly for free if it can help others. That being said, if you choose to use it, you use it at your own risks, there is no warranty (see the [licence](./LICENSE) for more details).
