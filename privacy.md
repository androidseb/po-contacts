# PO Contacts Privacy Policy

## What this policy applies to

This privacy policy applies to all versions of the PO Contacts app.

## Introduction of this privacy policy

This privacy policy explains how PO Contacts can access, use, store, or share your personal data. In short, PO Contacts never accesses, uses or stores your personal data outside of your device or your cloud account. Some sharing features of PO Contacts allow you to explicitly share some data outside of your device or cloud account, but except that explicit manual sharing process initiated by yourself, PO Contacts never shares your data outside of your device or cloud account.

## Definition of personal data

The personal data collected by PO Contacts is under the form of user contact information: the list of contacts the user can enter or import into the app.

## How PO Contacts accesses your data

The contacts data is collected by PO Contacts when you input the info manually or imports the info as files or though other apps. When you grant PO Contacts access to your cloud account data, PO Contacts will use that access by reading from or writing to your cloud account data.

## How PO Contacts uses your data

PO Contacts uses the data locally on the device with the different PO Contacts features (displaying the contacts list, diplaying a contact information, etc.). When you grant PO Contacts access to your cloud account data, PO Contacts will use that access to search for existing contacts files created by you or shared by others with you. When syncing contacts data, PO Contacts will use the access to your cloud account data to download it on your device in order to be able to display it in the app.

## How PO Contacts stores your data

Your data is stored by PO Contacts locally on the device, or into your cloud account data if you choose to sync your data into your cloud account. A few things to note about the way your data is stored:
* The contact data stored inside the app's files is not encrypted
* If you have not configured cloud sync, then your data will not be sent to your cloud account
* If you have not chosen the encryption option with cloud sync, the contacts data stored to your cloud account will not be encrypted
* If you have chosen the encryption option with cloud sync, the contacts data stored to your cloud account will be password-encrypted with AES, with the password you have chosen
* If you have chosen for the app to remember the encryption password for your cloud sync, the password will be securely stored:
  * Using KeyStore on Android, via [flutter secure storage](https://github.com/mogol/flutter_secure_storage)
  * Using KeyChain on iOS, via [flutter secure storage](https://github.com/mogol/flutter_secure_storage)
  * Using NWJS's chromium cookies on desktop (cookies are encrypted by chromium)

## Where your data lives

Your data lives on the device and on any cloud platform you explicitly configured PO Contacts to sync to.

## How PO Contacts keeps your data

The data is kept on the device or on the cloud platforms as long as you don't delete it manually.

## How PO Contacts share your data

PO Contacts does not share your data externally unless you perform explicit actions to share or sync your data. In the case of you manually sharing data from PO Contacts, the exported data could be sent to any app on the device you choose to share with. In the case of sync, PO Contacts allows you to configure an automated sync with some cloud storage platforms: your data is then shared by PO Contacts with those cloud storage platforms.

## What cloud storage platforms PO Contacts can use

Currently only Google Drive. When you grant access to PO Contacts to a cloud platform, that access is used solely to read/write contact synced data between the cloud platform and your device, and for nothing else.
